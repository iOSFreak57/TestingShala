  <h3>What you can expect and what we offer!</h3>
  <p>One of the most amazing innovations in online learning over the past few years has been the growth and development of massive open online courses, better known as MOOCs. Generally speaking, MOOCs are college-level courses made available, free of
    charge, for unlimited participation by any and all students interested in the subject matter. MOOCs are often offered by highly prestigious colleges and universities like Harvard, Stanford and, most predominantly, MIT, and taught by the same
    professors and instructors that teach them on their famous campuses.</p>
